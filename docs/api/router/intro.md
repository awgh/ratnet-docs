# Router

A ***Router*** in Ratnet is the piece of code that handles the routing of messages once they are unpacked from an incoming bundle.  There is only one implementation of this, the "default router", but it's worth mentioning that you can easily customize and modify the router as well, since this is the piece of Ratnet most people will want to tinker with.
