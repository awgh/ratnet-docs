# Transports

A ***Transport*** in Ratnet is the piece of code that handles sending and receiving messages to some actual method of transmission, like a network connection, a radio, a remote database, a filesystem, or any other mechanism used to relay blobs of data.

All ratnet transports are interchangeable.
